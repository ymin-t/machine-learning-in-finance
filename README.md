# MH6811 Machine Learning in Finance


## About this course
I took this course in July 2021 in NTU. I have learn and gain a lot of knowledge from this course.
Even though, about half of the course in online due to covid restriction. 
The professor did his best efforts to help the students understand the concept of machine learning. 
I have decided to share some of the problem and code for future students to reference.


## Summary
This course covers essential machine learning techniques in finance. The emphasis is placed on the financial applications 
and how can they transform the finance industry. This course will cover supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and deep learning. 
This course will also train the studentsâ€™ soft skills through the group project on realistic data analysis problem.
